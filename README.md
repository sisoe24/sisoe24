### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me

I am a VFX Pipeline TD, and my primary responsibility is to help studios create robust pipelines that improve all aspects of the VFX production process. I am passionate about my job and take pride in creating effective workflows, automating tedious tasks, and improving the creative process for artists and production teams. I strive to empower all departments and play a vital role in the studio's success.

#### Personal Projects and Free Time

In my spare time, I enjoy creating helpful tools to assist developers and individuals in their daily tasks. My expertise lies in languages such as TypeScript/JavaScript and Lua, and I have recently been exploring Go. Additionally, I tutor compositing artists, guiding them in developing their Python and PyQt/PySide skills. Currently, I am focused on developing NodeEditor, a Python-based visual scripting framework that streamlines artists' workflows and enhances their productivity.

I also enjoy consistently improving my dotfiles setup, knowing it is a never-ending process ðŸ˜…. Moreover, I am very invested in VJing and personal training, as there is no greater satisfaction than helping others achieve their fitness objectives and seeing the joy on their faces.
