#### About Me

Hey there! I'm based in New York and I am a VFX Pipeline Developer TD. My job is all about helping others create awesome visual effects, which means I get to play around with lots of cool tools like Python, Javascript, Lua, PySide2, Nuke, Maya, Blender, and more. 

Recently, I've been diving deep into the world of Golang, learning new data structures, and honing my algorithmic skills.

Programming is more than just coding for me. I find the philosophy behind it fascinating. Learning about best practices, design patterns, and the theories that drive software is something I really enjoy. I'm also curious about low-level programming and the intricate details that give us a peek into how computers work.

In order to truly excel at something, it's important to approach it from every possible angle. This approach has allowed me to continuously evolve, come up with new ideas, and genuinely enjoy my work from all angles.
