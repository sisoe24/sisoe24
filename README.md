### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About Me

I am a VFX Pipeline TD and my main responsibility is to help studios create strong pipelines that improve all aspects of the VFX production process. I am passionate about my job and take pride in creating effective workflows, automating tedious tasks, and improving the creative process for artists and production teams. I strive to empower all departments and play a vital role in the success of the studio.

#### Personal Projects and Free Time

In my spare time, I enjoy creating helpful tools to assist developers and individuals in their daily tasks. My expertise lies in languages such as TypeScript/JavaScript, Lua, and I have recently been exploring Go. Additionally, I provide tutoring to compositing artists, guiding them in developing their Python and PyQt/PySide skills. Currently, I am focused on developing NodeEditor, a Python-based visual scripting framework that streamlines artists' workflows and enhances their productivity.

I also can never seem to get enough of perfecting my dotfiles setup. It's an endless journey ðŸ˜…, but it's worth it! 

Aside from my love for software development, I also take pleasure in being a personal trainer and training others. Although it's not my primary focus, I derive satisfaction from imparting my knowledge and helping people reach their fitness objectives.
